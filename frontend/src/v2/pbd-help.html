                <p>Programming by Demonstration (PbD) is a technique that allows you to teach the robot a new action by moving
                    its arms and showing how the action should be performed. </p>

                <h2>How to teach an action</h2>
                <p>The robot detect tabletop object. You can click on "detect world instances" if it didn't detect all objetcs.
                    In the demonstration process, you manipulate the robots arm to create a simple action.
                    Note that the robot will compute the best trajectory between point and not recreate the specific mouvement you performed.
                    After the demonstration, it will show the precondition and effects of the action. You can suppress or add predicates if needed.
                </p>

                <h2>Create a problem to solve automatically</h2>
                <p>Once the robot has learned some action, you can give the robot a problem.
                    <br/> It will detect the state of the world at the beginning. You will give it a goal to achieve. It will
                    prepare a solution plan to solve the problem using the taught action. You can then execute directly the
                    plan or just save it for later.</p>
