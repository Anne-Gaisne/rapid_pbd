            <h1>Help</h1>
            <p>Programming by Demonstration (PbD) is a technique that allows you to teach the robot a new action by moving its arms and showing how the action should be performed. <br/>

                <h2>How to teach an action</h2>
                The robot observes the changes in the world state before.
                You can edit the detected condition to better the robot's world view as it can be to specific or not detailed enough.
                You manipulate the robot to do a certain action. After the demonstration,
                it will associate a final state of the world around the robot that can also be edited to help it understand the consequences of this new action.
                    
                <h2>Create a problem to solve automatically</h2>
                Once the robot has learned some action, you can give the robot a problem.<br/>
                It will detect the state of the world at the beginning.
                You will give it a gaol to achieve and it will prepare a solution plan to solve the problem using the taught action.
                You can then execute directly the plan or just save it for later.
